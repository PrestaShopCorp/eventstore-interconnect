# Major evlolutions of the project

### 1.0.22
On this version, seperation of concerns about the event handling :
- errors are emmitted when event is invalid, or not allowed, so then we can catch them with a general filter


### 1.0.21
On this version, more stability, more errors when problems appends, like connection issue.
Improvement of the example : it's now easy to copy paste what is needed to run the example, all is more explicit and we only have to connect to the correct interface, write the event we want and check that it works.
